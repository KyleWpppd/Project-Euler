* These are my solutions to Project Euler Problems

These problems fascinate me because generally I don't know the mathematics behind the problem, so I first research them and see if an existing formula exists. Then, I try to write that formula in code. For problems where a formula or algorithm does not exist, I try to derive my own.

With the newer solutions, I have included a README file with the problem to be solved along with some of my general notes and ideas of how to solve them.
