2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

/* be smart, and recognize that if you have four and five, you have 20. So we just need to cover our primes, and the factors for each component between 1 and 20... so 8 would be covered by 16 since it is 2*2*2*2... also covering 2 & 4 simulaneously...
