Problem 9
25 January 2002

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a**2 + b**2 = c**2
For example, 3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.


NOTES:
Since a < b < c, c must be 997 or less (1 < 2 < 997). Obviously this doesn't help much, but it does help a little.

General formula for generating a Pythagorean triple
a = k*(m^2 - n^2)
b = k*(2mn)
c = k*(m^2 + n^2)
where m, n and k are positive integers with m > n
so to find our value for 1000, we need:
k*(m^2 - n^2) + k*(2mn) + k*(m^2 + n^2) = 1000
making more sense:
2*k(m^2 + mn) = 1000

and dividing by 2:
k(m^2 + mn) = 500

And when using a modulo operator, we can eliminate k and look for
500 % (m^2 + mn) == 0

This further restricts the set we have to look for since m**2 < 500. => m < 23. 
We will derive this ceiling programmatically so that the function can be reused.




because then
k == 500 / (m^2 + mn)
and we have solved the problem.

Then we must verify to ensure:
a**2 + b**2 == c**2
